# Machine Learning Security Operations aka MLSecOps
![MLSecOps Banner](https://github.com/Benjamin-KY/MLSecOps/blob/main/MLSecOpsV1.png)

## What is MLSecOps?
Welcome to our MLSecOps project. This project focuses on integrating machine learning with security operations to enhance the security of machine learning operations (MLOps). Here, you'll find a mix of code, research papers, training, useful links, and resources dedicated to MLSecOps.

## Contributing is always welcome
We welcome contributions! Please read our Contributing Guide for details on our code of conduct, and the process for submitting pull requests to us.

## Courses to Learn ML, MLSecOps, AI Assurance, AI Ethics etc etc

I will note two labels/metrics before each link. The first is x/5 where x is the required knowledge about ML/AI in order for the content to be useful. x = 1 is the least required, x =5 is the most. The second label is Vendor-Agnostic or Vendor-Centric. Enjoy!
